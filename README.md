Source
======

Source is a compiled programming language designed to cross-compile. It compiles into SIL, a bytecode language, which then can be ported to many different platforms. Source can also be interpreted.

UPDATE: 4/28/2015: Source is no longer in development; [Typhon]( https://github.com/iconmaster5326/Typhon) is being dveloped instead, and will be sytactically similar to Source.
